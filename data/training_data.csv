3895,app keeps telling me my password is incorrect and im unable to access my account has been like this for days and days very disappointed and not pleased with this app especially considering i do all my banking online
7626,great app super easy to use
3601,cant use the app because the sv is not working it keeps on displaying and always says something went wrong when enabling it such an inconvenience 
2860,fix ur app just want to sign in my account pls
7525,new update is giving me so much trouble for deposite a cheque i tried so many times but every time it didnt recognize the picture nd always says try again

1456,the sv cant be disabled it breaks connection with rd party applications i use for cash rewards and it has limited features compared to other banks this is an awful application
5348,it telled me to so i did
2141,the deposit a cheque works great thank you
6629,the app worked fine until the recent design changesupdates now it doesnt show me any recent transactions under my accounts i can only check transactions using past account statements but thats useless when i cant see my transactions that happened since last statement i dont want to wait a whole month until the next statement is ready useless cant even search for transactions by namevendor as the search box doesnt work this app has gone from good to just terrible will uninstall
4676,so far so good im new to scotiabank and their app is impressing me the interface needs a few tweaks and as far as i can tell its missing a few functionalities it might be that i am not seeing them or they arent yet available on the app keep up the good work
6543,im constantly inundated with offers for a  credit card offer that only lasts for x ammount of time when the offer expires the hard sell starts all over again cant open the offers screen goes black and then nothing shows up slow to load external links freeze and crash other banks have better offers and apps looking into switch banks
4479,app crashes all the time takes  attempts to log in properly
7049,scotiabank bank fails to solve the international transfer issue to the uk
8334,the best bank i ever had easy to communicate and you great promotions

4152,worst bank ever got ripped off by an atm and now my money wont transfer over 
6842,sv continually needs to be reset for some stupid reason everytime i log on i have to reverify perhaps ensuring something like this doesnt have bugs should be prioritized before releasing it to the public

8250,trying to deposit a cheque using their app is beyond frustrating and buggy
4576,its an extremely useful app the images used to sometimes take a while to get right but recently i havent had any problems i can only assume the app is improving as we go along thank you for saving me gas and unnecessary trips to the bank
7624,while using the pay bills feature my account is not displayed in the selections i have been managing bills through this app and now this bug is forcing me to migrate to my other bank account
8902,ever since the new and unneeded app update the scotia app doesnt allow you to pay off your credit cards from your chequing account anymore
839,system maintenance ruined a good thing app was working well now cant even sign on not helpful and  minute wait to talk to customer servicei dont have that time available

1718,much improved experience great progress
4721,meh nothing really special about the scotia app comparing to other banks the one thing i do really like is the dark mode option
4759,by far the worst banking app and even worse customer service and experience it rarely worked properly and now with  step verification it doesnt work at all an absolute joke good luck calling the number they give in order to fix it just do yourself a favor and switch banks
18,very rewarding
134,its faster to walk to the bank and deposit my cheques in person than fight with this terrible app

4222,the app keeps crashing every time i login immediately i get past the login screen i see my account and the app closes then my phones show that the app has a bug which is why it keeps crashing

6697,excelent
39,lots of errors
8945,extremely sloppy auto capture for cheque deposits cant even do manual capture anymore since no frame guide is around to follow making it it impossible to deposit cheque through the app now

528,so convenient banked there for years now
3662,this app was working great and then out of nowhere it stopped i wasnt able to sign in it didnt say if it needed a upgrade on the app i had to uninstall it and install it again in order for it to work other than that i like the app
247,id give it negative stars if i could this app is so bad im switching banks scotiabank is the absolute worst nobody else in my family or friends has an account with them and i can see why any other bank seems to have functional apps and no issues i could go anywhere else and have a better experience guaranteed sb is useless their app and customer service are garbage their reply here is stupid you think i didnt complain to multiple people at sb first they were all rude  didnt help
8659,i love everything about this bankwhen i first came here they helped me get to a good start
2707,works perfectly
8885,not working properly with new update and takes more time to open the menu
7863,for anyone else who is clueless when it asks you for a pin now after you enter your password it wants the pin you use to unlock your phone took me forever to figure that out i have a lot of pins never knew the scotia app knew my phone pin
9048,the fa system is god awful and never works too bad you are forced to set it up being locked out of your account for days at a time sure is fun
4706,scotiabank is good
5506,i cant pay my credit card from my checking account the option to pay is not available
8936,they made everything harder good for them

8284,app barely works ive had consistent issues just trying to open it
487,eh
1091,i have tried numerous times to signin after removing the twostep verification from one of my devices im now trying to sign in and the message that i get is it looks like you dont have step verification set up to sign in to your account on this device please open the scotiabank app and set up step verification return to sign in this appears to be a circular error as i enter my signin information and i continue to get the same message without a menu item for the step verification
5762,absolute trash app
5254,very user friendly
342,the app doesnt like to work anymore ive removed and installed it over again its still not working between this and holding peoples cheques constantly i dont know if im going to stay with this bank much longer

5981,update since last update im no longer able to sign in i get a deactivate sv ive done it  times and it keeps giving me the same window every time i cant even login via web browser unless i deactivate extremely frustrating
799,this app is not good moving money between my accounts within scotiabank is okay but anything else is too frustrating to bother with the web version also sucks so i guess it isnt any surprise that the mobile version is even worse
8230,very user friendly
8350,they charge me  per etransfer so much for loyalty
7415,app is keep crashing again and again uninstalled it completely and reinstall the app still same issue
8383,length use of app  years oppo phone samsung z flip i dont know why i see mixed reviews however personally this app is fairly easy to use navigation is straightforward havent experienced login issues unless the app was requiring maintenance it offers majority of what you need to avoid calling over the phone for information if i can make a suggestion to incorporate biometric into the login phase its reliable and saves time considering the complicated passwords we require nowadays
6760,i love it no regrets
5507,fantastic people understand what you wantthis app is awesome
6329,very bad experience unable to login while i am  sure my user name and password are correct

4556,simple and efficient
3856,cant log in  app crashes with fingerprint scanner and when i use my pass the app says the pass is wrong and its not  must be an update thats screwing up
982,great when it works but too often do i run into a login error or theres an issue on their end and i cant access my account unreliable access is really annoying when trying to access funds
3784,latest update is trash completely screwed up the cheque deposit feature i just spent  min trying to deposit my cheque worked fine before why you trying to fix something thats not broken beyond irritating
6296,scotiabank accounts frequently appear as unavailable and interac etransfers have taken over an hour to appear as notifications these challenges have never occurred as a client with another financial institution
2873,awesome
5033,so long and thanks for all the money
8439,never seems to work
7440,need online banking on the daily

3125,cant do enough through the app closing my accounts
253,have to keep reinstalling wont recognize pw
1746,very good service continue this goes a long way

2004,fingerprint login is not working on my pixel  my fingerprint gets recognised but does not login
2563,great
3618,stop forcing us to use lock screen on our own devices
6361,app works well only request i have to make it  stars is having the option for  time use etransfer its annoying having to add contact information every time to send e transfers most apps now have the ability to just add email or phone number and send as  time etransfer much easier and quicker also a recall or cancel feature for etransfers before they are received on ther end would also be great as other banks also have this feature
3277,app requires  factor verification but doesnt allow me to choose to use anything but text  and i dont have the ability to recieve that would love to be able to use authy or google authenticator
4476,cant login anywhere after last update the  step verification does not work
1523,i trust scotia bank which is something i wouldnt say of any other large bank
5775,no longer can log into my account
1035,fast secure and reliable service always
2916,nice hotel with exceptional staff great locationclean rooms with comfortable beds spacious parkingi would stay here again very quiet
4034,i was fine with the old app this new app doesnt allow me to make prepayments to my mortgage i thought new apps meant more options and new features not less
8993,cant even sign in says session timed out right away and cant use online banking because i need the app to set up fa
1817,it has stopped letting me do transfer through the ap
1972,app
6853,very fast
8159,image recognition software for cheque deposit is pretty bad and cant correctly identify the cheque amount plus its stupid that i had to download the app to deposit a cheque why is there no online banking option available
6140,good
2530,i cant say i have any complaints but overall i cant say my experience has been superior to anyorger back i have worked with
1957,bit of a surprise when i first opened the app but it seems ok so far
3481,today the app is saying there is a problem and asking me to deactivate fa it feels suspect otherwise the app was working well
1359,every few weeks when i need to use the app it crashes and wont even let me log in it will glitch and say sorry something is wrong a bunch of times so i have to uninstall the app and reinstall it then have to disable and enable  factor authentication every time god forbid i need to move money around asap for food the issue has been happening for about a year and its making me heavily consider switching banks after years of business with scotiabank
831,im having problem to log in since a week ago
6351,scotiabank well screw you over harder than you think
3414,not letting me deposit an etransfer
2939,easy to use user friendly
7654,the app keeps crashing since the last update and still hasnt been fixed after reporting the issue i am unable to log in using this app works fine with my ipad also reported a discrepancy in scotiabank visa transaction accurate on my monthly statements but not on the appwebsite representative escalated the issue but the discrepancy still hasnt been resolved
2898,keep having trouble with  step verification since the last update
7125,crashes and locks up constantly since a recent update navigating between screens causes the app to lock up and stop responding takes forever to load anything when it does work i would call this app garbage but honestly garbage would work better at this point
3100,if i could give scotiabank  stars i would
628,app wont let me send any e transfers needs work asap
1238,update now get an error please retry after update how do they make it worse each time the app was once quite good is now almost completely nonfunctional takes about  attempts to log in each time you would think the exorbitant fees they charge to hold your money would allow them to at least build a functioning app
2975,the two factor authentication doesnt send notifications to my phone and breaks my online banking and makes it so i cant sign in on my pc which is  more convenient i avoided it for awhile but im changing banks guna go to a credit union see you scotia
2819,the best
1941,good interface and easy to use
3007,why us your widget app keep saying this feature is currently unavailable ive been with scotiabank since  i hope this isnt the beginning of more problems
4097,starting yesterday my cellphone stopped receiving notification from this app therefore i can no longer log into my bank account even on my desktop computer this is definitely horrible and ridiculous
3616,cannot get more than a couple of months of statement history
771,very irritating app cant get in and weve used scotiabank on line for years totally exasperating
7150,this is a terrible app it keeps on crashing
6763,easy to use online banking has made life very easy
5799,i cant compliment this place enough the staff were friendly and helpful the hotel itself was comfortable and welcoming and the food and service at caseys were outstanding
4773,safe time and fast
6928,i am pleased with my service very rarely is it unavailable depositing cheques has been surprisingly easy
7151,lots of glitches and you still cant schedule a future bill payment they keep saying coming soon but the feature never gets indtalled very amateur app for a big  bank update now i cant even deposit a cheque auto deposit cannot be turned off awful total garbage
1151,great app
1755,no commrns
242,wont even let me log into my account
5992,you room was clean i dont like that you have my email address when i didnt give it to you though      
1414,this app is absolutely garbage constantly deleting and reinstalling for it to work problems never fixed would give less then  start if i could
1237,ever since they forced the sv i can no longer access any of my banking and they are completely useless in trying to help take the sv off cant even remove as it myself because it wont let me
3028,very easy app to use
4649,scotia has really made their banking app userfriendly
1815,very easy to use and navigate
2815,everything works except mobile deposit doesnt really deserve  star but thye updated the photo deposit  months ago and doesnt work at all
2097,since the update widget doesnt work just keeps cycling such a disappointment
2639,seriously can log into scotiabank online with a browser but cant on the app if i try my username it just says try again if i try my card number it says try again how badly have you messed up your app
3989,two stars for the last update i cant access one of my accounts now ugh
8648,easy to use
1283,auto pay often removes payments from account day ahead resulting in overdrafts
5886,you updated it and now its broken just crashes when trying to sign in deleted and redownloaded still broken well done 
9159,easy to use
5748,horrible time
2227,easy to use
4344,great app user interface is very intuitive and easy to navigate
3432,its good except ive been having problems getting into my banking app it keeps asking me to sign in for  step verification but wont let me scroll down now i cant make any check deposits or do any etransfers
8541,absolutely total garbage scotia likes to charge fees but they dont understand customer service pathetic
587,easy
2554,havent set it up yet
2076,simple and easy to use banking app
1437,its convient and easy to use
2606, step verification is a total headache i had to replace my broken phone and because the old one wasnt usable i got locked out of my account it took me like  days to figure out how to access my own bank account
8024,wont let me login since the new update
4497,excellent bank easy to deal with one issue would be the amount of offers and emails
1910, april  update is so useless that now i can not deactivate the  part verification from phone and can not login to online banking on the computer because it is sending yes its me prompt on the phone but app is not working it says call customer service which i did and was told to wait  hours android app has issue thanks scotiabank this is my second review for this app i have only  reviews since the smartphone invention fix asap  found out only one review allowed by google
841,the app is perpetually crashing its super inconvenient and has left me very frustrated as it is an integral part of my working day
3714,i have to answer the security question everytime i login while i use fingerprint and then they ask if i want the  step verification on top of that is there a way to turn those features off check deposite is horrible it doesnt focus ever cant turn off the auto capture just to deposit  checks it takes  minutes ridiculous i never go bellow the minimum balance to save the monthly fee and they still charge me for etransfer to be honest im not sure why im still with them
9162,used the app for years with no issues now fa is outright forced so app has been uninstalled i wont be using it
574,dont know how many people i know including my self have been declined by scotiabank card or app even when there has been sufficient funds avaible i dont even know why i still deal with scotia
3636,the motel was located across the street from the palm beach dubai locks we had restaurants and shopping all around perfect location very clean rooms and great service
3590,only works with  of the checks i try to deposit
390,is good
5316,wont let me log in it tells me to click a notification to say its me never get the notification tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing changes
3701,app is garbage and down every other week and this has been an issue since i opened with scotia in 
5953,easy enough for not overly computer user people
454,awesome
3749,its a good appcould use more options
1797,reliable
6494,excellent
7830,had the app for a few years and never had a problem with it until recently it forced me to set up the  step verification now i have the hardest time trying to sign in i have to either uninstall and reinstall it or change my password completely to sign in terrible terrible update
2870,this app is beyond aggravating i have a temporary loaner phone and i had too jump through hoops to check my own bank balance  i had to reset  step verification there is no option to ignore this  ignore my phone as primary reset up my loaner phone with two step verification and set up a brand new pin there should be an easier way to check your bank balance on your mobile device
4749,ads getting in the way of day to day banking the select pay ad comes back every time i open the app despite me clicking the x on it already
1826,exceptional appeasy to use and very helpfulawesome bank
221,slow and too many hoops to jump through to get to final destination
1589,good money
4145,never had an issue with scotias app they really are a great bank one of the better ones for sure

8574,something happened in an update a while back that has seriously affected the performance of the app it takes about a minute now to get to the login and passwords are no longer saved its chunky moving around the app and then when you go to close it itll lock up your phone for another minute no idea what happened but its an absolute nightmare to use this app these days

7359,app started crashing all the time started on thursday i uninstalled the app and reinstalled it worked for a few hours now it keeps crashing again this morning hopefully it gets fixed soon ill change my review once this gets fixed edit app works great now changed my review to  full stars
7412,app used to work pretty well but now i was sent a new card and it wont let me do anything unless i verify the cvv which it says is invalid i tried contacting support but it just shows a blank screen i cant even log out of my account without force closing the app because it confirms if i want to sign out but then does nothing
1900,in my almost over  years of using the app it spiraled consistently down mastercard statements could not be viewed logging out also is a nightmare
7047,so often the app doesnt work properly doesnt show your balance or doesnt show pending transactions always something wrong
1418,smooth quick and perfect
8640,it wont let me log in whenever i want it is constantly being fixed or unable to connect every update it feels like a different app and every time it asks for more info to log in i get security is important but why i need  passwords is this app this weak and insecure i like this bank but if you tell us all in your banks that we have to use this app to make simple tasks and we cannot use that app it is just too frustrating

50,app is trash i always spend  mins plus trying to deposit a cheque by taking a photo always on a dark surface well lit all corners in frame everything it states to do but yet it can never deposit i always end up having to go to an atm or in branch whats the point of the feature super frustrating
3098,pretty good no real issue easier then going to the bank every payday
6207,depositing a cheque use to be so easy now it can never capture it properly so frustrated with this new update
5010,flawless victory
7965,i dont understand why they wouldnt put your balance on the end of each line it makes it very confusing and near impossible to keep track of your transactions what reason other than to confuse you or keep things unclear could there be its definitely not to the users benefit and isnt that the point of the app to make things simple and easy to keep track of other than that its  as for scotiabank itself and their customer service horrible please fix
406,i am fully satisfied with this online banking app
4578,thank you scotiabank
852,very glitchy and badly executed features that most of the time doesnt work smoothly this is the worst mobile banking experience i have ever had

6820,over charged on service fee
4969,last weekend i couldnt transfer any money out of my savings account this weekend i am unable to emt money or have access to any of my accounts customer service is piss poor and am more than likely moving all my accounts to a more reliable bank fed up with scotiabank being one of the largest buisnesses in canada and not taking any responsibility when customers are unable to access their own money they should be fined
8896,depositing cheques has been broken since early december not sure what benefits are supposed to come with the updated cheque deposit interface hard to consider scotiabank a good banking experience when there is little experience to be had since you cannot deposit your money with them edit jan  update came depositing a cheque still doesnt work regardless if auto capture is on or off if its still an issue come february i will be changing banks
3752,how is it that this bank can report  million in earnings and cant have a competent app developer make and maintain the app what an absolute crapshow this app is i am very seriously considering going to the bank of cash in the mattress at this point  out of anything
1645,app keeps telling me to disable fa that i didnt agree to authorize in the first place and then tells me oops something went wrong
7231,very easy to use

7352,has improved significantly since their original release
4140,great service
3445,does exactly what it should the app works better than accessing via mobile browser if only because i feel silly starting a twofactor authentication login on my phone only to have to confirm my identity also using the same device the app is far more streamlined than the browser and much recommended if you do a lot of mobile banking
7954,does what it needs to do
1833,great app
8561,great service and fast
9157,very very glitchy on my last  pixels
