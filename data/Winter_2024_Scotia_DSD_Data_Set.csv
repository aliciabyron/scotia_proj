43,2023-10-04 15:44:22,2,en,2309.0.0,3,Cheque deposit works now. The recent problem is in regard to the minimum amount required in the momentum account. Bill payments often come out near midnight and sometimes that brings the account below the minimum. Then you get charged the account fee because you're below the minimum. The amount in the account should be calculated at a certain time (end of business day perhaps) rather than at midnight on the calendar day

I had to put it into my regular account wait five business days for a hold and then transfer it to the bank account I wanted it to go into. So that kind of defeats the purpose of the app for me

Scotiabank needs to allow people to do certain things with their accounts when there's maintenance being performed. Today for example at 12.40 a.m. I needed to send an e-transfer and I couldn't do it through the app or online. They shouldn't be doing system maintenance to both the app and online at the same time.

Rep told me she removed the 2 step, I did get into my banking on my pc while she was waiting for me to try. Success! However, on the next day, same darn thing happened. I cant get into my banking on my pc. The two-step appl was not removed. Called customer service back AGAIN!!!!. Now rep tells me she cant remove it now to do my mobile banking. She had to check with her supervisor and finally got the 2-step appl removed from my home pc AGAIN!!!! But, also telling me, I cant no longer do mobile banking without the two-step app it as it is now required by their banking system. Ok, I will be inconvenienced but as long as I can do my online banking on my home pc, I'll be ok...The next day, for the 3rd day in a row, I cant do my online banking on my pc again without the 2-step appl kicking backed in again. Why are these people advocating an application which doesnt work!!!! Do I have to be inconvenience again and called customer back again for the third time? Heck with that.

Adding bills or registering email for automatic desposits needs work. I also think itemized transations for auto loans are needed. The app also redirects to web for functionality that isn't built in which doesn't feel enagaging it safe. Maybe a call-back feature for interest would be better and also offer an option for more information if desired (then redirect).

After that try long press the Scotiabank icon in android phones and select other options like Send Money / Pay bill etc. You will be able to open the app. Probably it should be a technical issue opening the default screen of the app

3562,2022-01-16 08:09:40,1,en,,0,2 step verification system is dumb thought with no second choice like an email. Essentially it tides the mobile banking to the phone so if your phone is dead or not in your possession while you're trying to log in from a computer you'll be out of luck. Also no opt out of 2SV is possible. Last I remember Scotiabank doesn't pay for my device therefore shouldn't tide it to the security process and should be a option to opt out . If things don't change I will eventually move to another bank .

After id been a victim of fraud they refused to get rid of my derogatory statements despite court demand (i have papers) and are the direct reason im out over a grand. Not only will they deny reimbursement for NSF fees they wont even let you get overdraft even if youve proven to be able to pay that off (by paying every NSF fee despite their hundreds of freaking dollars i could be saving with overdraft WHICH THEY KEEP OFFERING ME.

Today I can't sign in to my app or account on the website which means I can't pay my rent today because your update now forces a 2-step verification that doesn't even work. I now have to email the landlord and explain why my rent payment is going to be late due to your apps issues that you guys won't fix. This is not the only problem I have had lately with you guys and I will be switching banks soon because I'm tired of the constant problems.

I did get a personal call from my Scotiabank branch about the eventual blurry cheque I deposited and the cheque went through. I expressed the concern although I think the staff at the branch level is unaware of the issue. Scotiabank has good customer service.

My card was stolen and Scotia told me I'd have to wait over a month with no bank card or access to my bank while they figured it out so I didn't get my $ back that was stolen from my card. They are extremely unhelpful with everything. The only reason I haven't switched banks is because it's painful to switch banks on all your payments/bills. I have alot of funds but they won't give me over draft. Avoid this bank if u can.

Their online banking goes down at least once or twice a week. How can you be a major bank and have this many problems? I don't understand it. They don't offer any kind of apology or reimbursement for the down time either but they are happy to take your money every month for account fees. If you are looking for a bank look elsewhere.

You can no longer sign in and use it unless you sign up for 2 step verification which saves your debit card number in the app and shows it as soon as anyone opens the app. I do not want to sign up for this and Scotiabank cannot delete it from my account. The customer service rep keeps saying she is removing it from my account but all it does is reset and request I sign up for it. 2 step verification does not make your account more secure.

6361,2023-06-05 21:49:30,4,en,2305.0.0,17,App works well. Only request I have to make it 5 stars is having the option for 1 time use etransfer. It's annoying having to add contact information every time to send e transfers. Most apps now have the ability to just add email or phone number and send as 1 time etransfer. Much easier and quicker. Also a recall or cancel feature for etransfers before they are received on ther end would also be great as other banks also have this feature.

It's really annoying when u just want to quickly check your balance. I also used to love the quick balance widget feature!! But now it doesn't show my balance unless I have very recently signed into my actual Scotiabank app. If u have to sign into the actual app to get the widget to display your balance. Than what exactly is the point in having the widget??
